# Code for creating a chart-based probing experiment

## Notes
1. The already generated data is generated on CPU.  
If you want to use it on cuda or mps, you should delete the all the data in the data directory  
and run the experiment. The data will be created automtically on the right device.

2. If you get bored you can:  
    - Write docstrings
    - Write a dataloader instead of the handmade one
    - Write comments in general
